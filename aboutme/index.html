    <h2>David York</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone! My name is David, as you can probably tell from the name above. I am majoring in computer science and currently a junior here at BYU-Idaho.</p>
    <p>I am married with three kids, the picture above shows my first-born, Astrid. Did we name her after the "How to Train Your Dragon" movie? Yes. Did we pick that name for that sole reason? No. 
        In fact, Astrid means "One of divine beauty," or "Dedicated to God" according to some sources. </p>
    <p>I look forward to working with all of you this semester, and good luck on all your classes!</p>
